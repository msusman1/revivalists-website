<p>In the annals of history, names like Al-Ghazali, Ibn Sina, and Ibn al-Haytham shine as beacons of knowledge and intellectual prowess. These scholars made groundbreaking contributions to philosophy, medicine, and the sciences, creating a legacy that many modern Muslims look back on with pride. However, this reverence for a distant past, while inspiring, has a double-edged effect on contemporary Muslim societies.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">The Dual Consciousness of Historical Reverence</p>
<p>The habitual glorification of historical figures tends to bifurcate the collective Muslim psyche into two contrasting eras: a golden age of scientific and intellectual achievements and a perceived stagnation in the present. This division is more than just a nostalgic yearning for the past; it’s a psychological refuge that allows contemporary societies to dwell on bygone glories rather than face the realities of the present.</p>
<p>Such a mindset creates a form of mental indulgence—a comfort zone where historical achievements overshadow the pressing need to foster contemporary intellectual growth. It serves as a reminder of what was possible but also as a subtle implication that such heights are no longer reachable.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">The Need for a Present-Day Intellectual Renaissance</p>
<p>For Muslim communities to thrive in today’s rapidly changing world, an intellectual revival is necessary. This does not simply mean increasing educational achievements or technological advancements but fostering a culture that values critical thinking, innovation, and scholarly pursuits across all fields, including the sciences, humanities, and the arts.</p>
<p>The creation of a new generation of scientists, philosophers, polymaths, tech developers, and AI experts is crucial. These individuals will not only contribute to their fields but also inspire others to pursue knowledge and innovation. The goal is to transform societies into hubs of learning and creativity that are engaged with the global community.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">Overcoming Challenges</p>
<p>The road to intellectual revival involves overcoming several key challenges:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Creating a ‘thinking paradigm’. We need to creare a tolerant environment where different idreas can flourish.</li>
<li>Reigniting the Classical &amp; Post-classical thinking where natural science and inquiry was not seen incompatible with Islam.</li>
<li>Breaking the Orientalist narrative that Islam and science cannot exist togather.</li>
</ol>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">Conclusion</p>
<p>While it is important to honor the contributions of past scholars, it is equally vital to invest in the present and future intellectual capabilities of the Muslim world. An intellectual revival is not merely beneficial; it is necessary for the prosperity and advancement of societies. By focusing on creating an environment that nurtures innovation and values contemporary achievements, Muslim societies can ensure that they meet the challenges of the 21st century head-on, creating a legacy that future generations will look back on with pride and admiration. This revival is not just about reclaiming past glory but about building a new era of prosperity and intellectual achievement.</p>

<p>In today’s world, where the lines between business, culture, and ethics are often blurred, marketing has become a tool used to justify behaviors and practices that were once considered morally reprehensible. A glaring example of this manipulation is the way certain industries justify the objectification of women and even the promotion of harmful substances. The argument that these practices are “just marketing” is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to normalize immoral behavior. But the question remains: <em>Should we accept these practices just because they’ve been rebranded as marketing?</em></p>
<p>The logic behind this justification is deeply flawed, and it raises critical questions about the ethical boundaries of commerce and the manipulation of public perception. Let’s take a closer look at this issue and dissect the dangerous ramifications of such justifications.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">1. The False Logic of Rebranding Inappropriate Content as Marketing</p>
<p>Marketing, by definition, is the act of promoting and selling products or services, often with the intent to persuade the consumer. However, marketing itself does not justify the moral implications of what is being sold. Simply because something is marketed does not make it right. The marketing of women’s bodies, for example, is an undeniable practice in many industries today, where women are reduced to mere commodities to be sold for profit. But what makes this acceptable? The answer, disturbingly, is that it’s being marketed as “normal.”</p>
<p>The logic used by those who promote such objectification is clear but deeply flawed: <em>Just because something is marketed, it should be accepted as legitimate.</em> This line of thinking is not only dangerous but also insulting to the intelligence of any thoughtful person. The argument is based on a fallacy—by simply renaming an immoral act as marketing, it doesn’t transform it into something acceptable. If anything, it only exposes the hollow justifications behind such practices.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">2. The Double Standard: Why Are the Promoters’ Women Not Part of This Narrative?</p>
<p>One of the most glaring hypocrisies in this narrative is the absence of the very women who promote such practices within these marketing campaigns. The question arises: <em>Why are the women of those who push this objectification not involved in these industries?</em> If this is just a “normal” and acceptable practice, why aren’t the wives, daughters, and sisters of the industry’s most vocal proponents also part of this objectification?</p>
<p>The reality is that these promoters—often wealthy and influential figures—are the very ones who keep their own women out of the limelight of such exploitation, yet they shamelessly promote it as a legitimate industry. This creates a stark contrast between the lives of those who market these products and the lives of the women they objectify. This glaring inconsistency calls into question their true motives and whether their justification of marketing is just a smoke-and-mirrors attempt to shield themselves from the moral repercussions of their actions.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">3. Comparing Marketing with Harmful Substances: A Hollow Justification</p>
<p>To further illustrate the absurdity of this justification, one must look at how harmful substances, such as alcohol and drugs, are also marketed. The same argument that defends the objectification of women is also used in the promotion of substances that are illegal or harmful to society. Alcohol, for instance, is marketed everywhere—yet it is restricted in certain cultures and religions because of its destructive potential. Cocaine, similarly, would be marketed in a world without regulation, but the legal restrictions prevent such normalization.</p>
<p>By this logic, if marketing alone can make something legitimate, then why stop at women’s objectification? Why not normalize the marketing of harmful substances or immoral acts? It is clear that the argument is not grounded in any form of rational morality or social good—it is a convenient excuse to exploit the vulnerable for personal profit.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">4. The Danger of Normalizing Harmful Practices</p>
<p>What is truly at stake here is the normalization of harmful practices under the guise of business. When we accept that marketing can justify the objectification of women, or the promotion of substances like alcohol, we create a dangerous precedent. The argument is simple but devastating: <em>If we can normalize these practices through marketing, what’s to stop us from accepting even worse forms of exploitation in the future?</em></p>
<p>This line of reasoning dismisses centuries of moral and ethical thought. Just because something is popular or profitable does not make it right. The fact that such practices are accepted and promoted by some simply because they are marketed is an affront to human dignity. It suggests that the value of a human being—whether a woman or a community—is ultimately defined by how much profit can be extracted from them.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">5. Conclusion: A Call for Ethical Marketing Practices</p>
<p>It is crucial that we challenge the misguided arguments that justify the objectification of women and harmful substances as mere products of marketing. Marketing, when used ethically, has the potential to promote good, but when it is employed to manipulate or normalize harmful practices, it becomes a tool of exploitation.</p>
<p>We must stop allowing marketing to be an excuse for actions that go against our values, morals, and common sense. It is high time that we demand greater accountability from industries that profit off the exploitation of vulnerable groups, and from individuals who use their influence to push such narratives.</p>
<p>Ultimately, marketing should not be a justification for the illegitimate or harmful—it should be a means of promoting products, services, and ideas that uplift society, contribute to the common good, and respect the dignity of all people. Until we address these fundamental issues, we will continue to find ourselves in a world where unethical practices are masked as “normal” through clever marketing techniques, leaving society to pay the price for this moral decay.</p>

        description: "In Pakistan, the Television Rating Point (TRP) system has sparked endless debates about its authenticity, with many questioning its effectiveness in accurately reflecting the preferences of the public. While there is no denying the widespread desire to reduce reliance on TRP as a measure of success, one must ask: Does TRP genuinely represent the content that the people want to see, or is it merely a reflection of what is being forced upon them?

<p>In Pakistan, the Television Rating Point (TRP) system has sparked endless debates about its authenticity, with many questioning its effectiveness in accurately reflecting the preferences of the public. While there is no denying the widespread desire to reduce reliance on TRP as a measure of success, one must ask: <em>Does TRP genuinely represent the content that the people want to see, or is it merely a reflection of what is being forced upon them?</em> The issue goes beyond numbers—it’s about the content itself and whether it aligns with the values and interests of the people, or if it is being manipulated by media moguls to push an agenda.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">1. TRP—A Flawed Reflection of Public Taste?</p>
<p>The idea of TRP as an indicator of what people are watching is fundamentally flawed. If the measure of success is simply which drama is attracting the most viewers, then <em>Ertugrul Ghazi</em> and <em>Salahuddin</em> are clear evidence of what audiences gravitate toward. These dramas, rooted in Islamic history and cultural pride, garnered immense popularity, even surpassing locally produced content. But what does that say about the current state of the Pakistani media?</p>
<p>The question arises: <em>Is TRP genuinely telling us what people want to watch, or is it just telling us what’s available to them?</em> With limited alternatives and restricted content choices, viewers are often left with no option but to watch what is presented to them. The absence of variety distorts TRP as a real reflection of audience preference—people are watching what is available, not necessarily what they desire.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">2. The Real Problem: The Power Struggle Behind Censored Content</p>
<p>The success of foreign shows like <em>Ertugrul Ghazi</em> presents a significant problem for Pakistan’s media industry. It’s not just about what the public wants to watch—it’s about what the media powers want them to watch. Dramas that deviate from the mainstream, such as those featuring historical Islamic heroes, often face censorship. Why? Because such shows undermine the media’s narrative and disrupt its carefully constructed agendas.</p>
<p>The true reason behind the halting of shows like <em>Ertugrul</em> is simple: it challenges the status quo. It’s not just the content, but the way it portrays history, ethics, and values that creates unease within the media circles. The portrayal of history and heroism in such shows threatens to overshadow the fabricated, sensationalized dramas that dominate the Pakistani TV landscape today. And while the media calls these shows “inaccurate” or “distorted,” the fact remains that the public’s overwhelming interest in them reveals a much deeper desire for meaningful content.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">3. The Myth of “Obscenity” in Content: Is It Really the Issue?</p>
<p>One of the core objections raised against dramas like <em>Ertugrul</em> is the claim that they distort facts. However, the real issue lies in the objection to the content’s values. It’s often labeled as <em>obscene</em>, yet the same criticism isn’t leveled against the vulgarity seen in many local Pakistani dramas. The modern media landscape, driven by profit, often glorifies scandalous relationships, family dysfunction, and exaggerated conflicts, all under the guise of entertainment.</p>
<p>So, if we’re truly concerned about the moral impact of media on society, why aren’t we questioning the ethics of the local content that promotes mindless entertainment, devoid of any substance? The real issue isn’t whether <em>Ertugrul</em> distorts facts—it’s whether our current media content is actively shaping a generation that values superficiality over substance.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">4. What’s Missing in Pakistani Dramas? A Call for Real Representation</p>
<p>If the concern is about how the next generation will turn out, we must ask: <em>What kind of role models are we showing them?</em> The local Pakistani drama industry is replete with repetitive, formulaic content—romantic plots, family feuds, and melodrama. But what about the real stories that reflect Pakistan’s diverse experiences?</p>
<p>Why aren’t we seeing shows that depict the struggles of our farmers, the everyday heroes in our villages, or the unsung figures in Pakistan’s history? Where are the stories of people like Raey Ahmad Khan Kharal, who fought for freedom and justice? If the media is truly committed to reflecting reality, why isn’t it telling the stories that matter—those that are grounded in the lived experiences of the common people?</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">5. The Need for a New Vision: Reviving Pakistani Drama with Meaning and Purpose</p>
<p>The Pakistani media industry has immense potential, but it’s currently trapped in a cycle of producing content that serves the interests of a few, rather than the public. If we want to reclaim the TRP ratings and build an industry that reflects the true interests of the people, we must create content that speaks to the core of Pakistan’s identity. This means showing stories that not only entertain but also educate, inspire, and provide alternative narratives to the mainstream.</p>
<p>It’s time to invest in quality content that portrays our real heroes, our true history, and our diverse culture. The Pakistani drama industry must evolve to reflect the values and aspirations of a nation ready for change. Only then will we be able to break free from the chains of a TRP-driven system that limits creativity and stifles the diversity of content that audiences genuinely crave.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">6. Conclusion: Challenging the Status Quo—A New Era for Pakistani Media</p>
<p>The time has come to challenge the way TRP is viewed and used in Pakistan’s media industry. The public’s demand for meaningful, educational, and culturally resonant content is undeniable. It’s not about taking foreign dramas as a benchmark; it’s about creating something that is authentically Pakistani—something that aligns with the values and aspirations of our people.</p>
<p>If the media industry is serious about regaining trust and relevance, it must break free from the constraints of TRP and offer viewers content that truly matters. Whether it’s through historical dramas, real-life stories, or content that reflects the challenges and triumphs of everyday Pakistanis, the future of our media depends on its ability to adapt to the changing needs of its audience. Only then can we create a media landscape that is not only commercially viable but also culturally and morally enriching.</p>

<p>In the heart of Pakistan, a country founded upon the principles of Sharia and intended to provide a halal lifestyle, there is a burgeoning crisis that threatens to undermine these foundational values. The secular media—encompassing television dramas, game shows, and cinema—has progressively deviated from our cherished principles, promoting content that starkly contrasts with the Islamic way of life. This deviation has not gone unnoticed by The Revivalists, a group committed to safeguarding Pakistan’s Islamic identity.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">Critique of Secular Media</p>
<p>The secular media’s persistent focus on themes of extra-marital relationships, adultery, and other morally questionable subjects is not merely disappointing but alarming. Such content blatantly ignores and disrespects the religious and cultural ethos of the majority of the Pakistani populace. It’s clear that these media outlets have chosen to prioritize sensationalism and profit over moral and ethical responsibility, effectively hijacking our cultural narrative.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">The Revivalists’ Response</p>
<p>The Revivalists are at the forefront of addressing this cultural hijack. As defenders of Pakistan’s Islamic identity, we are prepared to take decisive actions to challenge and correct the course of our national media. This includes initiating boycotts against those media entities that propagate un-Islamic values and, more critically, launching litigation aimed at these organizations. Our legal actions will target the violations of both national and Islamic laws, focusing on the indecent and vulgar content that these media outlets disseminate.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">Call to Action: Join the Movement</p>
<p>The time has come for every concerned citizen to take a stand. The Revivalists call upon you to join our cause, to stand united in the face of cultural erosion and reclaim the moral high ground that Pakistan was built upon. By joining our boycotts and supporting our legal actions, you contribute to a larger, communal effort to steer Pakistan back to its rightful path—one that honors and upholds our sacred values.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">Building a Constructive Alternative</p>
<p>Beyond the necessary confrontations with secular media, The Revivalists are committed to promoting and supporting media platforms that align with Islamic values. These platforms will serve as bastions of culturally and morally appropriate content, offering viable alternatives that not only entertain but also enrich our spiritual lives.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">Conclusion</p>
<p>Our mission is clear—reclaim and restore Pakistan’s cultural integrity. The Revivalists are dedicated to this cause, but our success depends on the collective effort of our community. We invite you to join us, to actively participate in reshaping the media landscape of Pakistan, ensuring it reflects our Islamic values and respects our cultural heritage. Together, we can safeguard our nation’s identity and secure a righteous path for future generations.</p>
<p>Important Note:</p>
<p>As Pakistani majority is Muslim, therefore we emphasis on Islamic vaues. However, The Revivalists believe in national inclusivity and our efforts are for Pakistanis of all religions/faiths.</p>

        description: "There is a troubling contradiction in the arguments put forward by those who defend certain harmful portrayals in Pakistani dramas. They claim that they are showing controversial acts—such as domestic violence or child abuse—not to normalize them, but rather to expose their evil and warn the public against them. However, the reality is far different. If you truly aim to expose something as wrong, it should never be shown in a way that makes it seem normal, acceptable, or even justifiable.",

<p>There is a troubling contradiction in the arguments put forward by those who defend certain harmful portrayals in Pakistani dramas. They claim that they are showing controversial acts—such as domestic violence or child abuse—not to normalize them, but rather to expose their evil and warn the public against them. However, the reality is far different. If you truly aim to expose something as wrong, it should never be shown in a way that makes it seem normal, acceptable, or even justifiable.</p>
<p>Take domestic violence as an example. When such violence is depicted on television, the purpose should be clear: to condemn it and show its harm. Yet, more often than not, it is presented without consequence, making the act seem almost normal. If the intention is to expose the evil of domestic violence, then why does it continue to be shown as an acceptable part of relationships in dramas? The truth is, this contradiction is part of a larger trend where certain harmful behaviors are being normalized under the guise of entertainment.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">1. The Glorification of Violence in Pakistani Dramas</p>
<p>One of the most disturbing trends in Pakistani dramas is the portrayal of domestic violence, but with a dangerous twist. If a man hits a woman, the drama rightly depicts it as a serious offense, a violent act that causes harm. But what happens when the situation is reversed? When a woman raises her hand against a man, suddenly it’s not treated with the same gravity. This inconsistency sends a dangerous message to viewers, especially to the women watching these shows.</p>
<p>In reality, no one should be hitting anyone—whether it’s a man hitting a woman or a woman hitting a man. Both are wrong. Yet, the portrayal in these dramas creates a false equivalence, suggesting that it’s okay for women to engage in violence against men without consequences. This is not just a distortion; it is harmful and misleading, as it paints a false picture of gender dynamics.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">2. The Hypocrisy Behind Glorifying Harmful Acts</p>
<p>This is where the contradiction deepens. In dramas that glorify harmful behavior, such as domestic violence, the justification used is that these acts are shown to raise awareness. But if that’s true, why is the behavior normalized? If you truly aim to expose an evil, why not show its negative consequences? For example, if child abuse (or bacha-baazi) is being portrayed, the message should be clear: it is a crime, and it has serious consequences.</p>
<p>But often, this is not the case. When child abuse is shown in dramas, there is no real consequence for the abusers. The same applies to other harmful practices like homosexuality, which, while a controversial subject in some cultures, is often glamorized or normalized in Pakistani dramas. If you claim to be showing these acts to expose their wrongness, they must be depicted as harmful, immoral, and illegal. Instead, they are often presented without any critical judgment, which is incredibly dangerous.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">3. The Dajjal Effect: Normalizing the Unacceptable</p>
<p>This brings us to a central point: the concept of <em>Dajjal</em>, or deception. The aim of the Dajjal, in this context, is to make something that is inherently wrong appear as normal. The media, especially the dramas that are being broadcast, plays a crucial role in this deception. By presenting behaviors like domestic violence, child abuse, and even homosexuality without condemnation, these shows are essentially normalizing them.</p>
<p>For example, if child abuse is being shown in a drama, the question must be asked: <em>Are you glorifying this act or exposing it?</em> If you are truly exposing it, then you must show it as wrong, punishable, and a violation of human rights. If it is wrong in reality, it should also be portrayed as wrong in the drama. You cannot hide behind a so-called “awareness campaign” while simultaneously presenting the act as something that doesn’t carry real-world consequences.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">4. The Double Standard: Confusing the Public with Mixed Messages</p>
<p>This hypocrisy is not just confusing—it’s dangerous. Pakistani dramas often mix these contradictory messages, making it unclear for viewers, especially the younger audience, to understand what is right and what is wrong. On the one hand, you have the justification of showing harmful acts to “raise awareness,” but on the other, you have these same acts being normalized and portrayed without consequences.</p>
<p>This creates a dangerous precedent where the boundaries between what is acceptable and what is not become blurred. If child abuse, domestic violence, or other harmful behaviors are presented as normal in the media, it is no longer enough to say that you are merely “exposing” them. You are, in fact, contributing to their normalization.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">5. Conclusion: The Responsibility of Media to Uphold Morality</p>
<p>In conclusion, the media has a responsibility to portray what is right and condemn what is wrong. If harmful behaviors such as domestic violence or child abuse are being shown, they must be depicted as immoral, illegal, and punishable. The argument that these acts are shown to expose their evil is a weak excuse when the portrayal only serves to normalize them.</p>
<p>If the media is truly interested in raising awareness, it must take responsibility for how it presents harmful acts. It must show their consequences, condemn them, and never glorify or normalize them. The <em>Dajjal</em> effect in media, where evil is disguised as normal, must be resisted at all costs. Our dramas, as a powerful tool of influence, should serve to uplift society, not deceive it.</p>

The question is: <em>What was this money really used for?</em> Was it to promote religious values or Asian culture? No, it was used to push agendas like homosexuality and other controversial topics, things that do not align with traditional Pakistani values. This is proof that the media is not being manipulated or controlled by any external power—it is simply acting in its own interests, free to promote whatever narrative it chooses.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">1. The Hypocrisy of Pakistani Liberals</p>
<p>Pakistani liberals often present themselves as champions of freedom and progress. But their actions tell a very different story. They may claim to support liberal values, but they lack the foundational respect for basic human dignity that their Western counterparts uphold. In the West, even with ideological differences, there is still an understanding that all people, regardless of their views, deserve to be treated as human beings.</p>
<p>Pakistani liberals, on the other hand, do not extend this same respect. They want liberalism in name, but only in a way that serves their own interests. They do not care about the welfare of the poor or marginalized in society; in fact, they see them as expendable, as objects to be controlled rather than fellow human beings to be respected.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">2. The Disrespectful Attitude of ‘Desi Liberals’</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of our sisters and daughters who work as air hostesses. They support their families with hard work and dedication. May Allah make their lives easier. But what’s shocking is the way some so-called “liberals” treat them. When these air hostesses are traveling abroad, especially in Western countries, these desi liberals behave in a completely servile manner. However, the moment they return to Pakistan, their attitude changes entirely—they act as though they are the masters.</p>
<p>This behavior reveals a deep-seated hypocrisy. <em>Desi liberals</em> don’t want equality; they need a class they can dominate. They do not view the workers as fellow humans but as inferiors to be suppressed. They believe in a system where there is no respect for basic human rights, where the worker is seen as nothing more than a tool. And this is the same class of people who pretend to champion liberal values in Pakistan.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">3. The Desire to Preserve the System of Oppression</p>
<p>Pakistani liberals claim to fight for women’s rights and social justice, but they are part of the very political system that perpetuates the inequalities they decry. Take, for example, the oppression faced by women in Sindh or Balochistan. They will speak loudly about these injustices, yet they are the same individuals who are embedded within the political parties strengthening the oppressive system. These are the people who benefit from a system that keeps the poor and marginalized under control.</p>
<p>When Pakistani liberals talk about rights and freedoms, they do so selectively. They push for freedoms that serve their own interests but never truly advocate for the rights of the broader population—especially the poor, the workers, or anyone who doesn’t fit into their circle. They don’t want real liberalism, because if real liberalism were to take hold, everyone—especially the marginalized—would gain rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>Pakistani liberals fear that a truly liberal system would mean that the poor would demand their due rights, that workers would demand justice, and that the oppressed would no longer tolerate their status. This is why they are committed to maintaining the existing system, even if it means continuing to exploit the very people they claim to represent.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">4. The Political Paradox</p>
<p>It is ironic that Pakistani liberals who claim to fight for human rights are actually working against those very rights in practice. They criticize the oppression in Sindh, the mistreatment of women, and the lack of opportunities in rural areas, but when push comes to shove, they are the ones who support the political structure that keeps these issues alive. They are the ones benefiting from a system that perpetuates these very problems.</p>
<p>They are not interested in real change. They are interested in keeping the system intact, one where they continue to enjoy their privileges while others remain oppressed. This is the true face of Pakistani liberalism—the same liberals who claim to fight for equality, yet undermine it every day in their actions.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">5. Conclusion: The Media and the Liberal Agenda</p>
<p>It is time to recognize the true nature of Pakistani media and its role in shaping public opinion. The media is not controlled by an external oppressor but is fully complicit in spreading the narratives that benefit certain elite groups. Similarly, Pakistani liberals are not interested in genuine liberalism—they are interested in maintaining a system that benefits them while keeping the marginalized in their place.</p>
<p>The media and the so-called liberal elite are two sides of the same coin. They are working together to promote an agenda that does not serve the people of Pakistan but rather serves the interests of a few. We must be aware of this and challenge the false narratives being pushed through both the media and the political system. Real change will only come when we reject the falsehoods and demand a system that truly serves everyone, not just the privileged few.</p>

<p>In many discussions, the word <em>Dajal</em> refers to something that seems real but is actually an illusion—something that is not true, but is presented as truth through manipulation or deceit. In the context of Pakistani dramas, <em>Dajal</em> can be seen as the way in which these shows present a false version of reality. They portray behaviors and actions that are far from acceptable as if they are normal and natural.</p>
<p>If we take a closer look at the stories in Pakistani dramas and compare them to the reality of our society, the question arises: <em>Is this really what Pakistani society has become?</em> Are these distorted portrayals truly reflective of our values, or are they a dangerous illusion created to mislead the public?</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">1. The Role of Dramas in Shaping Society’s Norms</p>
<p>Pakistani dramas have always been an essential part of family entertainment. But lately, the content being broadcast has increasingly showcased behaviors that are morally questionable and inappropriate. For example, in family dramas, we see scenes of brother-in-law and sister-in-law hugging or behaving in ways that are considered improper in many cultures.</p>
<p>The real issue lies not just in showing these actions but in normalizing them. By continuously airing such scenes, these dramas are trying to convince the audience that these behaviors are acceptable, even though they go against the moral fabric of society. This is what <em>Dajal</em> represents: presenting wrong actions as if they are perfectly fine and part of normal life.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">2. The Impact on the Younger Generation</p>
<p>The harm caused by these distorted portrayals is not limited to adults. The younger generation is also being exposed to this content. Pakistani dramas have started showing relationships and actions that are far from the values that most parents and communities hold dear. Children, who are in their formative years, are learning that such behavior is acceptable simply because they see it on television.</p>
<p>If we allow these negative influences to shape the younger generation, they will grow up thinking that such actions are part of everyday life. This can lead to confusion about what is right and wrong, and it could have long-term consequences for their understanding of healthy relationships and morals.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">3. The Breakdown of Family Values</p>
<p>Why is it that many fathers in Pakistani society feel they can no longer sit and watch TV with their daughters? Why are parents losing confidence in the media they once trusted? The answer lies in the content being shown on television. Today’s dramas no longer offer family-friendly entertainment; instead, they promote inappropriate content that is not suitable for young eyes, yet it airs during prime time when families are watching together.</p>
<p>In other parts of the world, particularly in Western countries, TV networks regulate when certain content is shown. Special advertisements and adult content are scheduled only when children are likely asleep. However, in Pakistan, inappropriate advertisements and content are aired at times when the whole family, including children, is watching. This not only compromises family values but also undermines the trust between parents and the media they consume.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">4. The Loss of Shame and Respect in Society</p>
<p>Our society used to have a strong sense of shame when it came to things like family values and modesty. But with the rise of these media portrayals, this sense of shame seems to be evaporating. Scenes that would have once been considered inappropriate are now shown without hesitation. The underlying message is that <em>this is normal</em>, even though it clearly goes against the moral teachings of our society.</p>
<p>If these portrayals were truly acceptable, wouldn’t they be happening within the homes of those who produce these shows? If such behavior were genuinely fine, why aren’t their own families engaging in it? The truth is, the behavior we see on screen is not part of our society—<em>it should not be</em>, and we must reject this false narrative.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">5. Conclusion: Protecting Our Values from the Dajal of Media</p>
<p>As a society, we need to be more conscious of what we are consuming through the media. The messages being sent through Pakistani dramas should align with our core values—values that protect families, preserve dignity, and respect our cultural norms.</p>
<p>We must not accept the illusion of normality created by these dramas. Just because something is portrayed on television doesn’t make it right. We must stand up against the normalization of inappropriate behaviors, and demand that the media be held accountable for the messages it spreads.</p>
<p><em>Dajal</em> in this sense is the illusion of normalizing harmful behaviors. We must recognize this deception and take action to protect our children, our families, and our society from these false portrayals. If we don’t, we risk losing the very values that have always guided us.</p>

<p>When we discuss the need for a media revival in Pakistan, we are speaking of a much larger societal revival. Media is not just a source of entertainment or information; it has become a powerful force that shapes the values, behaviors, and perceptions of an entire society. To restore the moral fabric of Pakistan, we must first understand that the state of our media is a reflection of the state of our society. If we want to revive the media, we must focus on curing the underlying disease, not just the symptoms. Addressing the issues within the media is essential because it has the power to guide society in one direction or another. Therefore, the media must be carefully managed and directed toward uplifting our collective values and traditions.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">1. Identifying the Root Cause: Treating the Disease, Not Just the Symptoms</p>
<p>The first step in any meaningful change is to diagnose the real problem. For years, there has been widespread acknowledgment of the depravity, moral decay, and lack of discipline in our society. Yet, too often, we focus only on the symptoms of this decline, such as rising instances of violence, disrespect for cultural norms, and the growing prevalence of immorality in the media. However, until we address the root causes—such as the pervasive negative influence of media—we cannot expect any real change.</p>
<p>The root of the issue lies in how media influences society. If we continue to talk about the lack of morality in the public sphere without addressing how the media is propagating these issues, it will be akin to applying a bandage to a wound without treating the infection. We must look beyond the surface level and investigate the underlying factors that contribute to the spread of depravity.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">2. The Power of Media: A Single-Handed Driver of Society’s Direction</p>
<p>In today’s world, the media is not just a passive source of information; it is a primary force shaping society. Whether through television, films, social media, or advertising, media plays a pivotal role in guiding public opinion, shaping norms, and influencing behaviors. The content that is broadcast to the public determines how people perceive themselves and the world around them.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that media has become a force that can steer society in any direction—positive or negative. If the media promotes positive, wholesome content that aligns with our cultural and moral values, it can help reinforce the pillars of a strong society. But if it normalizes immorality, glorifies violence, and misrepresents our traditions, it will lead to the degradation of our values.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">3. The Need for Media Management: Steering the Ship in the Right Direction</p>
<p>Given the immense power of the media, it is crucial that we manage it responsibly. Media is no longer just a passive tool for entertainment; it is an active driver of societal change. It is not enough to merely criticize the immoral content being aired; we must actively take steps to redirect media content towards something that uplifts society.</p>
<p>This is not just about censorship—it is about taking charge of the media landscape. Whether it is television dramas, films, or even digital media, we must ensure that what is being produced and consumed aligns with the values of our society. A free media system is important, but freedom without responsibility can lead to chaos. We need a media system that is accountable, transparent, and aligned with the cultural and moral values of Pakistan.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">4. Reclaiming Media for the Good of Society: A Holistic Approach</p>
<p>Reviving the media is not just about eliminating harmful content; it’s about creating content that serves as a positive force in society. We have an abundance of untold stories that can educate, inspire, and uplift the public. From dramas that showcase our history and cultural heritage to films that portray the values of family, respect, and honor, the media has the potential to be a powerful tool for good.</p>
<p>But for this to happen, there must be a concerted effort to support and create content that reflects the true essence of our society. It is not just about opposing what we don’t like—it’s about actively promoting what we believe in. Content that highlights our national heroes, our traditions, and our Islamic values should be encouraged, funded, and celebrated. The more positive content we create, the more we can influence the next generation to follow these values.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">5. Ensuring Legal and Shariah Accountability: The Role of the Law</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the revival of the media must be done within the framework of Pakistan’s laws and Islamic teachings. While we advocate for media freedom, we also believe that there must be boundaries. Content that promotes harmful behavior—whether it’s violence, disrespect for women, or the normalization of sinful acts—cannot be allowed to continue unchecked.</p>
<p>The legal system must step in when media content violates both Pakistani law and Shariah law. We must ensure that media outlets are held accountable for their actions and that those who air immoral content face consequences. The legal and Shariah systems in Pakistan are designed to protect the moral integrity of the society, and these laws must be enforced to prevent further harm.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">6. A Call for Unity: Mobilizing Society to Take Action</p>
<p>The media cannot be transformed by one individual or organization alone. It requires a collective effort from all sectors of society—government, legal professionals, media producers, and citizens. Lawyers, activists, and concerned citizens must come together to fight against the immoral content that is harming our nation’s values. By filing legal complaints, organizing campaigns, and advocating for better content, we can begin to reclaim the media for the betterment of society.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as Pakistanis, we must recognize that this is not just a fight for cultural preservation—it is a fight to ensure that the next generation inherits a nation that upholds the values of honor, dignity, and respect for Islam.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">Conclusion: The Path to Revival Begins with Us</p>
<p>Reviving the media is not just about criticizing what is wrong—it’s about taking action to make things right. If we want to revive Pakistan, we must first revive our media. By managing and directing media content in line with our cultural and Islamic values, we can ensure that the messages being sent to society are positive, constructive, and aligned with the values of honor and dignity.</p>
<p>This task is not easy, but it is necessary. If we do not take charge of our media, we risk losing the very essence of our nation. Let us rise together to demand a media that serves the public good and works to uplift society. The revival of the media is the revival of society—and it begins with each of us.</p>

<p>In recent years, we have seen a surge in campaigns, boycotts, and hashtags aimed at protesting the immoral content being aired on Pakistani media. While we fully support the idea of boycotting these channels, it’s important to recognize that boycotting alone is not enough. The laws of Pakistan and its constitution stand firmly in our favor, and if the media is violating these laws, why shouldn’t they be held accountable?</p>
<p>We do not advocate for violence or disruptive behavior; instead, we must take a firm, legal stance to make those responsible feel the consequences of their actions. If you break the law in an Islamic country, you must face the repercussions. It is time to send a clear message to those who use the media to promote haram (forbidden) content—there will be consequences.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">1. Legal Action Against Immoral Media: Holding the Offenders Accountable</p>
<p>While boycotts are a useful tool for raising awareness, they alone cannot bring about the desired change. We must leverage the legal system to fight these injustices effectively. If media outlets are airing content that violates Islamic principles or breaks the law, they must be taken to court.</p>
<p>Our goal is not to resort to violence or disruptive behavior but to ensure that those responsible for airing these unlawful and immoral programs face legal consequences. We will work tirelessly within the framework of Pakistan’s legal system to impose fines, file FIRs (First Information Reports), and ensure that those who perpetuate such harmful content are held accountable for their actions.</p>
<p>By making this a legal issue, we highlight that these acts are not just a matter of personal opinion or moral belief but are actual crimes according to both Pakistani law and Shariah law. We want to make it clear that these actions are punishable, and the people behind them will face the full force of the law.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">2. The Role of Shariah Law: Making Harams Actions Legally Unacceptable</p>
<p>One of the main objectives of our efforts is to highlight the legal and Shariah-based crimes that are being committed by those behind these TV dramas. We are not merely speaking from a moral perspective but from a position of legal and religious authority. When content that is haram (forbidden) is broadcast, it is not just a matter of bad taste or inappropriate behavior; it is a violation of the principles that guide our nation as an Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>The laws of Islam clearly define what is right and what is wrong. If media channels in Pakistan continue to air such content, they must be held accountable according to the law. The haram acts being shown in some dramas are not just a question of personal preference—they are a crime, both legally and religiously.</p>
<p>By filing legal cases and ensuring that punishments are imposed, we can send a clear signal that such actions will not be tolerated. This isn’t just about raising awareness; it’s about bringing justice in the form of legal action.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">3. Upholding Honor and Islamic Values</p>
<p>The core of this movement is the belief that the people of Pakistan will not tolerate such acts of moral degradation. If there is true honor in the people of this nation, as we believe, then these immoral acts cannot go on unchecked. Allah Ta’ala (God Almighty) has instructed us to refrain from major sins, and to seek His forgiveness for our minor ones.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that Allah’s mercy is vast, and He has promised to forgive those who sincerely repent. However, when these immoral acts are openly promoted through media, it becomes a collective responsibility to take action. The laws are clear: if these acts are sinful, they cannot be normalized in the media.</p>
<p>This is not merely a fight for the preservation of culture or tradition; it is a matter of fulfilling our duties as Muslims and as responsible citizens. Pakistan was created with a vision of upholding Islamic values, and it is our duty to ensure that this vision is not hijacked by forces that seek to destroy it.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">4. Mobilizing Lawyers and Legal Action: A Collective Effort</p>
<p>We are not alone in this fight. Lawyers from across the country are joining forces to help us bring these media giants to justice. The collective effort of these professionals will ensure that we have the legal support necessary to challenge these unlawful practices.</p>
<p>Our goal is not only to raise awareness but to take concrete actions that result in tangible consequences for those responsible. By filing FIRs, imposing fines, and using all available legal means, we will ensure that Pakistan’s media upholds the values that we, as a nation, hold dear.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">5. Sin vs. Rebellion: The Urgency of Legal and Moral Accountability</p>
<p>There is a distinct difference between personal sin and public rebellion. A sin committed in a person’s private life can be forgiven, but when that sin is normalized in public life, it becomes an act of rebellion against God. Rebellion is not easily forgiven, and it is necessary for us to prevent this rebellion from spreading further by taking legal action and upholding the constitution.</p>
<p>Normalizing sinful acts in society is an affront to the Islamic teachings that guide us. When media outlets air content that glorifies haram actions—such as domestic violence, exploitation, and immoral relationships—they are not merely showcasing personal vices; they are making those sins seem normal. This cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>To allow these sins to be normalized is not only a moral failing, but a rebellion against the divine laws that Pakistan was created to uphold. We must stop this rebellion by taking a firm legal stance and reclaiming Pakistan’s media landscape.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">Conclusion: A Call for Accountability and Justice</p>
<p>The message is clear: haram actions that undermine Islamic values will not go unchallenged. We will use every legal means at our disposal to ensure that those who promote such content in Pakistan’s media are held accountable.</p>
<p>As Pakistanis, it is our responsibility to protect the values that make this nation great. We will not allow the media to continue spreading harmful and immoral content. By coming together, raising our voices, and taking legal action, we can protect the future of our nation and ensure that our children inherit a country that upholds Islamic principles and respects our sacred values.</p>
<p>May Allah guide our efforts and grant us success in our mission to protect the moral and legal integrity of our nation.</p>

<p>The Revivalists movement stands as a beacon of hope for those who believe in reclaiming Pakistan’s rightful place as a nation grounded in Islamic values. The efforts of individuals like Qaiser Ahmad Raja, who works tirelessly to strengthen the movement, have been nothing short of inspirational. Through their dedication, we are reminded that the cause of reclaiming Pakistan from liberalism and secularism is not just a political endeavor—it is a religious duty, a moral obligation.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">1. The Importance of the Cause: Securing Pakistan’s Islamic Future</p>
<p>At the core of the Revivalists’ mission is a deeply rooted belief that Pakistan’s future must be shaped by its Islamic identity. Our vision is clear: to restore the country’s foundations that were envisioned at the time of its creation. Pakistan was meant to be a sanctuary for those seeking to live according to Islamic principles, and it is crucial that we stay true to this foundational vision.</p>
<p>The task ahead is not easy. We are fighting a cultural battle against the forces of liberalism and secularism that have gained ground in our society. These ideologies threaten the very essence of what Pakistan was created to stand for. But this battle will not be fought through violence, vandalism, or hate. We are committed to peaceful and legal means of reclaiming our nation. This is the path prescribed by our religion and in line with the system of justice that Islam upholds.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">2. The Vision of The Revivalists: A System of Unity, Respect, and Consultation</p>
<p>The Revivalists movement is not simply about opposition to secular forces; it is about building a strong, unified, and just society. One of the key pillars of our approach is a consultation system that upholds the rights of every individual. Everyone within the movement has the right to voice their opinions, ensuring that decisions are made collectively and fairly.</p>
<p>The organization is structured in a way that promotes efficiency and discipline. Each department has its own head who works without interference from others, ensuring that work is carried out smoothly and effectively. There is no room for personal egos or self-interest in the Revivalists’ approach—everything is done with the goal of serving the larger cause.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">3. The Role of Religion in the Revivalists’ Vision</p>
<p>What makes the Revivalists different is our unwavering commitment to Islamic principles. Unlike many secular or liberal movements, we do not rely on personal opinions or political ideologies. Our actions and decisions are rooted in what Islam teaches us. The Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) guide our every step. The foundation of our efforts is not just political, but spiritual—a return to the principles that guided the early days of Islam.</p>
<p>This commitment to religion is what drives us. It is not about personal gain, power, or control; it is about creating a society that lives in accordance with the teachings of Islam. Every action, every initiative, and every decision is made with the aim of fulfilling the will of Allah (SWT).</p>

<p>The Revivalists are not just a group of individuals; we are a collective force determined to bring about lasting change. But we cannot do this alone. It is essential that those who believe in the importance of Pakistan’s Islamic future stand with us. We must unite under the banner of Islam and work together to reclaim our nation from the grip of secularism and liberalism.</p>
<p>Our strength lies in our unity. By working within the legal and moral framework set forth by our religion, we can achieve our goal of a peaceful, prosperous, and just Pakistan—a nation that honors its Islamic heritage and remains true to its founding ideals.</p>
<p style="color: #f7bd00;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 24px;font-weight: bold">Conclusion: A Path Forward with Integrity and Faith</p>
<p>As the Revivalists continue their work, we must remember the larger goal: reclaiming Pakistan for Islam and ensuring that future generations inherit a country built on the values of justice, peace, and righteousness. With the help of Allah and the unwavering dedication of our leaders and supporters, we will continue our efforts.</p>
<p>May Allah bless the efforts of Qaiser Ahmad Raja and all those involved in this movement. May He strengthen our resolve and guide us on the right path as we work to make Pakistan a beacon of Islamic values in the modern world. Let us work together to build the future of this nation, with faith, unity, and determination.</p>
