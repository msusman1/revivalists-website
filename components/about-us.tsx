              Why is the time now? Because we are witnessing a world where false ideas are eroding our identities and
              values. Adversaries are actively working to misguide and claim the hearts of our generations, leading them
              away from their true purpose. In these times, the need for awareness is no longer a choice but a
              necessity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              At Revivalists, we raise our voice to protect and empower. We are committed to awakening the common man to
              the traps laid before us, fostering an unshakable understanding of our spiritual and cultural heritage.
              Our mission is to inspire individuals to reclaim their dignity and responsibility, standing firm against
              the currents of falsehood.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Together, we should strive for a revivalâ€”a return to the purity of authentic values, grounded in truth and
              unity. By educating and guiding with sincerity, we aim to save not only this generation but generations to
              come. This is what being a revivalist truly means.

              Our culture is our identity. In a world where the media come to a point of increasing secularism, we stand
              for guarding; otherwise, we shall lose fundamental cores of Islamic values. To this regard, we shall
              utilize legal avenues to oppose the cultural invasion of the secular media and advocate for their content
              to respect our tradition while enriching our minds. Our commitment to non-violence is steered on
              democratic principles as we embrace freedom of expression in calling for peaceful boycotts. Our success
              will be measured not only by the visible reduction in harmful and valueless content but also by the paved
              media that uplifts and educates.

              Precisely because of that, we labor in reviving that culture of inquiry and innovation. We wish to ensure
              that by the year 2035, we shall create a generation of 500,000 new scientists, philosophers, polymaths,
              tech developers, and AI experts who shall remain rooted in our cultural ethos and be able to take up the
              reins of the world in scientific and technological advancements. Our journey will be charted through the
              use of ongoing assessments of our work, which will ensure that we are on track and follow the way of
              intellectual resurgence.
